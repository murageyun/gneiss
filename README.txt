Hi!
Thank you for your interests in using Gneiss. Gneiss is a research prototype that experiments using spreadsheets to interact with web services and create data-driven GUI applications. I have published several papers about Gneiss. You can find the papers on my website (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~shihpinc/gneiss.html). 

Unfortunately, as a research prototype, Gneiss is still buggy. I hope I will have time to keep fixing bugs, and also adding more documentations and tutorials on how to use it. (And move the code to Github!) 

To run Gneiss, you’ll need NodeJS and MongoDB. 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production

Gneiss’s server is written in server.js. To run the server, enter

node server.js


After Gneiss’s server is running, you can open Gneiss in the browser by entering

http://localhost:8000

You can change the port number in server.js & client.js file. 
I developed Gneiss using Chrome. Not sure how well it’ll run in other browsers. 

Some tips for using Gneiss: 
To enter data in Gneiss’s spreadsheet, you have to double-click on a cell. To extract a JSON field from the left pane to the spreadsheet, you have to select the field first by clicking on it, and then dragging it to a spreadsheet column. 

I have two demo videos on the website. You can try out Gneiss by doing the tasks in the videos. 

Let me now if you have trouble using Gneiss or have any questions about a particular feature described in the papers. 


Cheers,
